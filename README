    POE::Component::Github is a POE component that provides asynchronous
    access to the Github API <http://develop.github.com/> to other POE
    sessions or components. It was inspired by Net::Github.

    The component handles communicating with the Github API and will parse
    the JSON data returned into perl data structures for you.

    The component also implements flood control to ensure that no more than
    60 requests are made per minute ( which is the current limit ).
